* Introduction

~proxypox~ is my replacement for imgproxy written in Clojure. Mostly a learning experience, but I would like it to replace imgproxy in Alphabet Learning one day if possible.

* deps.edn

I need to brush up on what goes in here. [[https://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/getting_started/][Clojure Guides]] is probably a good help to get started with.

#+begin_src clojure :results output :tangle deps.edn
  {:paths ["src"]}
#+end_src

* core.clj

This is just to get a hello world up and running.

#+begin_src clojure :results pp :tangle src/org/yulqen/proxypox/core.clj
    (ns org.yulqen.proxypox.core)

    (defn -main []
      (println "Hello,world!"))

    (defn greet
      "Greet these people"
      [person1 person2]
      (str "Hello, " person1 " and " person2 "!"))

    (comment
      (greet "tobby the lar" "sniggers")
      )


#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: nil
